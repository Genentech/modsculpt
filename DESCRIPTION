Description: Additive modeling algorithms are crucial for working with tabular data in machine 
  learning. Such models offer intrinsic interpretability and frequently have optimal or 
  near-optimal performance. In many cases linear additive models (fit via classical statistical 
  models or using regularized methods, depending on the number of features) have optimal 
  performance. However, in general it may be necessary to use non-linear functions of the 
  features and use constraints on those functions to ensure trustworthiness. The Model Sculpting 
  method has been developed to construct such additive models; it involves creating a strong 
  learner (often a black box model with optimal performance), extracting an additive 
  approximation of it, pruning negligible features, and refining the model for smoothness and 
  feature relevance. The package modsculpt provides the necessary code to implement this Model 
  Sculpting pipeline.
